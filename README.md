House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts house prices based on the number of rooms in a house. It uses a simple machine learning model (Linear Regression) to train on a dataset and make predictions.

Project Description
In this project, a Linear Regression model is trained to predict house prices based on one feature: the number of rooms in the house. The dataset used is from the Boston Housing dataset, which contains real estate data. The model is trained on a portion of the data and then tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.

Technologies Used
- Python: The programming language used for building the model.
- Google Colab: The environment where the project was built and executed.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For creating data visualizations.
- Matplotlib: For plotting the graph.
- Scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model.
